# SolvIEEEit topic
Portable water testing and purifier Robot
## Inspiration
Given the topic for this competition was 'Facing pandemic with ideas' and we were required to base our project on the 17 UN sustainable development goals, after hours of research, we decided on four important goals to be dealt with-
Clean Water and Sanitation
Life below Water
Good Health and Well-being and
Affordable and Clean Energy 
We came across various methods and devices to test the water quality and came across one such device which attracted our attention and we felt the need to improvise it.

## What it does
It is a robot inspired from the original Water-snake robot.
A robot which can navigate through any depths and is designed according to the userâ€™s purpose, is used to test the quality of water.
It also purifies the water and makes it suitable for drinking.

## How we built it
we built this amphibious snake-like robot and designed in such a way that it navigates through the water with ease.
It composes of cylindrical modules stabilised by flexible joints which allows free motion.
To get more propelling force in the water, it consists of wheeled paddles.
It is embedded with pollution sensors to find out the concentration of various elements.
It contains electrochemical sensors to detect heavy metals such as lead and BIOSENSORS to detect bacterial presence.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge would be to embed the sensors in such a way that it records the maximum and accurate reading of the concentration of different materials.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
we were able to record the concentration with more accuracy and managed to use solar energy, one of the cleanest and cheapest energy source to run our device.

## What we learned
we definitely learnt how we can use our engineering skills to tackle problems in the society and help the world in anyway we could.

## What's next for Portable water testing and purifier Robot
We are still working on increasing the efficiency to make it 100% pure, drinkable water and we definitely feel it is possible.
